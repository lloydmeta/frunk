//! This module holds the machinery behind LabelledGeneric.
//!
//! A LabelledGeneric instance is pretty much exactly the same as a Generic instance, except
//! that the generic representation should contain information about field names.
//!
//! Having a separate trait for LabelledGenerics gives us the freedom to derive both
//! lablled and non-labelled generic type class instances for our types.
//!
//! Asides from the main LabelledGeneric trait, this module holds helper methods that allow
//! users to use LabelledGeneric without using universal function call syntax.
//!
//! In addition, this module holds macro-generated enums that map to letters in field names (identifiers).
