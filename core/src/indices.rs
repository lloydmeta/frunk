//! Types used for indexing into HLists and coproducts.

//! frunk frequently uses phantom index types as a technique to avoid

//! Currently, `Index` type parameters in traits are not ever really intended
//! to be selected by the user, and are instead simply solved for by type
//! inference wherever the compiler can see that there is a unique solution.
//! Therefore, you don't really have much of a reason to use the things in this
