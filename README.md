The general idea is to make things easier by providing FP tools in Rust to allow for stuff like this:

```rust
use frunk::monoid::*;

let v = vec![Some(1), Some(3)];
assert_eq!(combine_all(&v), Some(4));

// Slightly more magical
let t1 =       (1, 2.5f32,                String::from("hi"),  Some(3));
let t2 =       (1, 2.5f32,            String::from(" world"),     None);
let t3 =       (1, 2.5f32,         String::from(", goodbye"), Some(10));
let tuples = vec![t1, t2, t3];

let expected = (3, 7.5f32, String::from("hi world, goodbye"), Some(13));
assert_eq!(combine_all(&tuples), expected);
```

## Examples

### HList

Statically typed heterogeneous lists.

First, let's enable `hlist`:
```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate frunk; // allows us to use the handy hlist! macro
use frunk_core::hlist::*;
```

Some basics:
```rust
let h = hlist![1];
// Type annotations for HList are optional. Here we let the compiler infer it for us
// h has a static type of: HCons<i32, HNil>

// HLists have a head and tail
assert_eq!(hlist![1].head, 1);
assert_eq!(hlist![1].tail, HNil);
```

HLists have a `hlist_pat!` macro for pattern matching;
```rust
let h: Hlist!(&str, &str, i32, bool) = hlist!["Joe", "Blow", 30, true];
// We use the Hlist! type macro to make it easier to write 
// a type signature for HLists, which is a series of nested HCons
// h has an expanded static type of: HCons<&str, HCons<&str, HCons<i32, HCons<bool, HNil>>>>

let hlist_pat!(f_name, l_name, age, is_admin) = h;
assert_eq!(f_name, "Joe");
assert_eq!(l_name, "Blow");
assert_eq!(age, 30);
assert_eq!(is_admin, true);

// You can also use into_tuple2() to turn the hlist into a nested pair
```

You can also traverse HLists using `.pop()`
```rust
let h = hlist![true, "hello", Some(41)];
// h has a static type of: HCons<bool, HCons<&str, HCons<Option<{integer}>, HNil>>>
let (h1, tail1) = h.pop();
assert_eq!(h1, true);
assert_eq!(tail1, hlist!["hello", Some(41)]);
```

### Generic

`Generic` is a way of representing a type in ... a generic way. This enables you to have reusable functions that can work
with many different types, and yet allow you to get back to your original types if you so wish.

Frunk comes out of the box with a nice custom `Generic` derivation so that boilerplate is kept to a minimum. 

Here are some examples:

#### Turning any HList into your Struct

```rust
extern crate frunk;
#[macro_use] // for the hlist macro
extern crate frunk_core;
use frunk::*; // for the Generic trait and HList

#[derive(Generic, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Person<'a> {
    first_name: &'a str,
    last_name: &'a str,
    age: usize,
}

let h = hlist!("Joe", "Blow", 30);
let p: Person = from_generic(h);
assert_eq!(p,
           Person {
               first_name: "Joe",
               last_name: "Blow",
               age: 30,
           });
```

This also works the other way too; just use `to_generic` and pass in a struct.

#### Converting between Structs 

Sometimes you may have 2 different types that are structurally the same (e.g. different domains but the same data). This can
happen when you have a model for deserialising from an external API and another one for your domain logic.

Generic comes with a handy `convert_from` method that helps:

```rust
// Assume we have all the imports needed
#[derive(Generic)]
struct ApiPerson<'a> {
    FirstName: &'a str,
    LastName: &'a str,
    Age: usize,
}

#[derive(Generic)]
struct DomainPerson<'a> {
    first_name: &'a str,
    last_name: &'a str,
    age: usize,
}

let a_person = ApiPersion {
                   first_name: "Joe",
                   last_name: "Blow",
                   age: 30,
};
let d_person: DomainPersion = convert_from(a_person); // done
```


### Validated

`Validated` is a way of running a bunch of operations that can go wrong (for example,
functions returning `Result<T, E>`) and, in the case of one or more things going wrong, 
having all the errors returned to you all at once. In the case that everything went well, you get
an `HList` of all your results. 

Mapping (and otherwise working with plain) `Result`s is different because it will 
stop at the first error, which can be annoying in the very common case (outlined 
best by [the Cats project](http://typelevel.org/cats/tut/validated.html)). 

To use `Validated`, first:
```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate frunk; // allows us to use the handy hlist! macro
use frunk_core::hlist::*;
use frunk::validated::*;
```

Assuming we have a `Person` struct defined
```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
struct Person {
    age: i32,
    name: String,
    street: String,
}
```

Here is an example of how it can be used in the case that everything goes smoothly.

```rust
fn get_name() -> Result<String, Error> { /* elided */ }
fn get_age() -> Result<i32, Error> { /* elided */ }
fn get_street() -> Result<String, Error> { /* elided */ }

// Build up a `Validated` by adding in any number of `Result`s
let validation = get_name().into_validated() + get_age() + get_street();
// When needed, turn the `Validated` back into a Result and map as usual
let try_person = validation.into_result()
                           // Destructure our hlist
                           .map(|hlist_pat!(name, age, street)| { 
                               Person {
                                   name: name,
                                   age: age,
                                   street: street,
                               }
                           });

assert_eq!(try_person.unwrap(),
           Person {
               name: "James".to_owned(),
               age: 32,
               street: "Main".to_owned(),
           }));
}
```

If, on the other hand, our `Result`s are faulty:
```rust
/// This next pair of functions always return Recover::Err 
fn get_name_faulty() -> Result<String, String> {
    Result::Err("crap name".to_owned())
}

fn get_age_faulty() -> Result<i32, String> {
    Result::Err("crap age".to_owned())
}

let validation2 = get_name_faulty().into_validated() + get_age_faulty();
let try_person2 = validation2.into_result()
                             .map(|_| unimplemented!());

// Notice that we have an accumulated list of errors!
assert_eq!(try_person2.unwrap_err(),
           vec!["crap name".to_owned(), "crap age".to_owned()]); 
```

### Semigroup

Things that can be combined.

```rust
use frunk::semigroup::*;

assert_eq!(Some(1).combine(&Some(2)), Some(3));

assert_eq!(All(3).combine(&All(5)), All(1)); // bit-wise && 
assert_eq!(All(true).combine(&All(false)), All(false));
```

### Monoid

Things that can be combined *and* have an empty/id value.

```rust
use frunk::monoid::*;

let t1 = (1, 2.5f32, String::from("hi"), Some(3));
let t2 = (1, 2.5f32, String::from(" world"), None);
let t3 = (1, 2.5f32, String::from(", goodbye"), Some(10));
let tuples = vec![t1, t2, t3];

let expected = (3, 7.5f32, String::from("hi world, goodbye"), Some(13));
assert_eq!(combine_all(&tuples), expected)

let product_nums = vec![Product(2), Product(3), Product(4)];
assert_eq!(combine_all(&product_nums), Product(24))
```

## Todo

### Stabilise interface, general cleanup

Before a 1.0 release, would be best to revisit the design of the interfaces
and do some general code (and test cleanup).

### Benchmarks

Benchmarks are available in `./benches` and can be run with:

`$ rustup run nightly cargo bench`

It would be nice to use something like [bench-cmp](https://github.com/BurntSushi/cargo-benchcmp) to compare
before and after, but for some reason, there is no output. Should investigate why.

### Not yet implemented 

Given that Rust has no support for Higher Kinded Types, I'm not sure if these
are even possible to implement. In addition, Rustaceans are used to calling `iter()` 
on collections to get a lazy view, manipulating their elements with `map`
or `and_then`, and then doing a `collect()` at the end to keep things
efficient. The usefulness of these following structures maybe limited in that context.

0. `Functor`
1. `Monad`
2. `Apply`
3. `Applicative`
